# OSTI-API

Python code to pull records from the OSTI.gov API. Records largely include the published works of projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

## How to Use This

Everything in this project is driven from the Jupyter notebook `OSTI API Querying.ipynb`. 

1. First, click on the `launch binder` badge/shield at the top of this README file in order to launch the project in your browser. 
2. Then, on the page that opens eventually (should be a list of project files, including the IPYNB file mentioned earlier), click on `OSTI API Querying.ipynb`. 
3. This will open a new tab. There are further instructions on how to run the code inside the notebook itself.

Good luck!
