0,,"['Dong, Changgui', 'Sigrin, Benjamin']",,,United States,,"Distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), are likely to comprise a substantial fraction of new generation capacity in the United States. However, forecasting technology adoption based on people's willingness to pay (WTP) faces two major challenges: the stated-intention and omitted-variable biases. Previous solar adoption literature has neglected to address these two biases altogether. Here, we adopt a 'parameterization + calibration' approach to address both biases and estimate customers' WTP for PV. After collecting survey data on respondents' WTP for adopting PV, we characterize its empirical cumulative density function using a gamma distribution. We further calibrate the gamma distribution parameters using a national distributed PV adoption simulation model, finding the parameters that produce the best fit between simulated and historic solar adoption. We then show that the calibrated gamma distribution improves the raw WTP data after correcting for the two biases. Finally, we use our optimally-calibrated WTP to forecast market demand for residential PV at the county-level of the United States in 2020. Improving estimates of customer willingness to pay has significant implications for policy directly, e.g. estimating the effect of a proposed policy on technology adoption, and other regulatory processes that use forecasting, e.g. integrated resource planning.",AC36-08GO28308,10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.017,2019-02-25T05:00:00Z,Medium: X; Size: p. 100-110,C,Energy Policy,129,English,"[{'rel': 'citation', 'href': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1494980'}]",1494980,Journal Article,2019-06-01T04:00:00Z,Elsevier,NREL/JA-6A20-66020,"['National Renewable Energy Lab.

Partial illumination induces local photovoltage variations that drive lateral current flow into non-illuminated cell regions, causing the average injection level to vary over the course of luminescence measurement. The extent of lateral current depends on material properties and is especially significant for high-efficiency devices such as the silicon heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) modules that we investigate. We compare four module imaging methods including large-area illumination, scanning-laser illumination, contactless electroluminescence, and pattern-illuminated photoluminescence. By evaluating the statistical correlation among the different methods under varying laser fluences, we conclude that most methods converge to similar results at matched photon dose per cell (not laser power density) for the modules that we study, while pattern-illuminated photoluminescence yields distinct images from the other techniques regardless of the illumination power. Our combined analysis using multiple luminescence imaging techniques gives specific insight into the causes of HIT module degradation, including suspected degradation of the transparent conductive oxide and passivation layer.",AC36-08GO28308,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.12.022,2019-01-23T05:00:00Z,Medium: X; Size: p. 81-87,C,Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,192,English,"[{'rel': 'citation', 'href': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1491141'}]",1491141,Journal Article,2019-04-01T04:00:00Z,Elsevier,NREL/JA-5K00-71930,"['National Renewable Energy Lab.

Silicone encapsulant specimens were artificially weathered under narrow band UV filters to determine the effects of individual wavelengths within the UV spectrum on the photodegradation of the cohesion of encapsulant material and its adhesion with adjacent interfaces. The threshold wavelength, signifying the upper bound of the damaging action spectrum for the silicone, was identified from the results. In addition, specimens were artificially weathered with different relative humidities to understand the effects of moisture on the rate of photodegradation. The adhesion energy was measured using a fracture mechanics approach. The complementary delaminated surfaces were characterized to determine the failure pathway and chemistry changes resulting from photodegradation. A previously developed model was modified to account for the effects of damaging wavelengths in the terrestrial solar spectrum and reciprocity law failure due to varying UV intensity during weathering. With these modifications, the model showed good agreement with the behavior of the silicone encapsulant exposed in an outdoor solar concentrator simulating concentrator photovoltaics operating conditions. Similar studies can be adopted to develop models that can have high predictive accuracies based on accelerated aging studies.",AC36-08GO28308,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.11.024,2019-01-08T05:00:00Z,Medium: X; Size: p. 486-492,C,Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,191,English,"[{'rel': 'citation', 'href': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1489188'}]",1489188,Journal Article,2019-03-01T05:00:00Z,Elsevier,NREL/JA-5K00-73005,"['National Renewable Energy Lab.

3,,"['Neises, Ty', 'Turchi, Craig']",,,United States,,"This analysis investigates the design, cost, and performance of the simple, recompression, and partial-cooling configurations of the supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle integrated with a molten salt power tower concentrating solar power system. This paper uses a steady-state model to design each cycle with varying amounts of recuperator conductance to understand performance and cost trade-offs. The recompression cycle can achieve a higher thermal efficiency than the partial-cooling cycle, and the partial-cooling cycle achieves a higher thermal efficiency than the simple cycle. The partial-cooling cycle is the most expensive cycle because it requires more total turbomachinery capacity. However, the partial-cooling cycle has the largest temperature range of heat input. This feature leads to cheaper two-tank thermal energy storage, higher receiver efficiencies, and lower mass flow rates in the power tower. Crucially, the lower mass flow rates significantly reduce pump electricity consumption relative to the recompression-cycle system. Consequently, this study finds that the power tower system integrated with the partial-cooling cycle is both cheaper and generates more net electricity than systems integrated with the other two cycles. Finally, this paper presents a parametric study on the air-cooler approach temperature and shows that small approach temperatures can improve cycle efficiency and increase the temperature range of heat input, which can lead to smaller optimal approach temperatures than may be expected.",AC36-08GO28308,10.1016/j.solener.2019.01.078,2019-02-25T05:00:00Z,Medium: X; Size: p. 27-36,C,Solar Energy,181,English,"[{'rel': 'citation', 'href': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1494976'}]",1494976,Journal Article,2019-03-01T05:00:00Z,Elsevier,NREL/JA-5500-72674,"['National Renewable Energy Lab.

The installed capacity at which violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is called the hosting capacity. Current methods for determining hosting capacity tend to be conservative by either only considering infrequent worst-case snapshots in time and/or only capturing coarse time and spatial resolution. Additionally, current hosting capacity methods do not accurately capture the time-dependence making them unable to capture the behavior of voltage regulating equipment and of some advanced controls mitigations. This can trigger delays from unnecessary engineering analysis or deter solar installations in areas that are actually suitable. We propose a quasi-static-timeseries (QSTS) based PV hosting capacity methodology to address these issues. With this approach, we conduct power flow analysis over the course of a full year, to capture time-varying parameters and control device actions explicitly.
